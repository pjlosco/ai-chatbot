Project Idea: AI-Powered Insurance Query ChatbotOverview: Build a chatbot that answers common health insurance questions (e.g., “What’s the difference between an HMO and PPO?” or “How do I enroll in ACA plans?”) using a fine-tuned LLM for natural language understanding and a simple ML model for classifying query types (e.g., enrollment, coverage, billing). The chatbot will run locally, store data securely to mimic HIPAA compliance, and include basic analytics to track query trends. Why This Project? Demonstrates LLM usage for customer-facing insurance tools, secure data handling, and analytics—core to their platform.
Skill-Building: Covers LLM fine-tuning, ML classification, local Flask deployment, and secure data practices, aligning with the role’s 1+ years of AI/ML experience requirement.
Local Feasibility: Uses lightweight tools (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn) that run on a standard laptop (minimum 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU recommended).
